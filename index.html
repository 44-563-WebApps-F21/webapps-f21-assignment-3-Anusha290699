                <h3>Karimnagar</h3>

                <p>Karimnagar is famous for its heritage sites such as <b>Gandhi centenary Museum</b>.
                    Located near Lower Manair Dam, on the outskirts of Karimnagar town is a famous <b>tourist attraction called Ujwala Park</b>.
                    Rajeev Gandhi Deer Park located near Ujwala Park, is known for its teeming deer population.It is a very good place to live.
                    Lower Manair Dam is the place where many people visit.I like this place because the people in the town are very friendly.

        <h3>Algorithm</h3>

        <blockquote site=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem"> The closest pair of points problem or closest pair problem is a problem of computational geometry.The closest pair problem for points in the Euclidean plane was among the first geometric problems that were treated at the origins of the systematic study of the computational complexity of geometric algorithms.A naive algorithm of finding distances between all pairs of points in a space of dimension d and selecting the minimum requires O(n2) time.
